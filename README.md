This package identifies UK postcodes that are within prescribed distances of
given UK postcodes. Those distances are in minutes by car, using OpenStreetMaps
for the routing. See search_parameters.py for information on how to set up the
search. The results will be saved as a pandas dataframe. A jupyter notebook
to view that dataframe of postcodes is provided and this can then be inspected,
e.g., sort by column etc. The table of postcodes that is used is downloaded
from https://www.freemaptools.com/download-uk-postcode-lat-lng.htm
